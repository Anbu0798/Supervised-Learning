This project explores various supervised learning techniques, including linear regression, gradient descent optimization, and regularization, to design a controller for managing aircraft ailerons. The performance of different models and settings is evaluated, and the best-performing model is selected based on its performance on the validation and test sets. In the final part of this assignment, additional coding tasks were completed using a different dataset. The results were submitted on GitHub, which involved creating a GitHub account and following a step-by-step process to set up an assignment repository. This process included cloning the repository, completing the provided ipynb notebook by answering its questions, and then uploading the updated notebook back to the repository. Finally, the work was submitted by pushing the changes to the GitHub repository.
